# Create data frame for levels of automation table
automation_levels <- data.frame(c(1:3, c("4a", "4b"), 5:7),
                                c("Ad hoc R code",
                                  "R project",
                                  "R project under version control (VC)",

```
## Current publication process

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/current_state.png")
```

- Complex (many steps between software)
- Prone to error
- Manual, menial tasks carried out by highly skilled people
- Not reproducible or sustainable


## The solution

```{r out.width = "60%", , fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/rap_matts.png")
```

[RAP companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/)

Combined the principles of **reproducible research** with **data science tools and best practice**.

```{r out.width = "55%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/desired_state.png")
```


## What is RAP?

- No (or few) manual steps = data and output produced using code
- High quality and auditable = version control
- Sustainable = peer review
- "Bells and whistles" = _functions, documenting/testing these functions, package management and computing environment_

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/rap.jpg")
```


## What is RAP?

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/rap_flow.png")
```


## [Levels of RAP/automation](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
    kable(automation_levels,
          col.names = c("Level", "Description"),
          format = "markdown")
```


## Challenges
- Culture change (peer review and working in the open)
- Senior management support
- New skills for analysts to learn (e.g. R, git)
- Required development time
- Range of data sources and/or unstable production process
- IT (RStudio server and internally hosted code repository)


## How to scale RAP in ISD?

- The [Transforming Publishing](https://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Transforming-Publishing-Programme/) (TPP) team have begun to roll out RAP to other teams in ISD using a buddy system

- One or two members of TPP 'buddy up' with another team to help them create a 
Reproducible Analytical Pipeline for their publication

- The bulk of the development work is done by the team being 'buddied'; TPP use a light touch approach to provide code reviews; 
offer assistance with R and Git; advise on timelines; and, more generally, offer guidance wherever it is required

- As a minimum, we recommend teams aim for level 4 (a or b or both) as laid out in our [RAP paper](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf)


## Before the buddying

- Prior to working on RAP, analysts in ISD must attend an introductory Tidyverse 
training course (run by [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/)) and 
a tutorial on using Git and GitHub (run internally by TPP)

- Following this, we ask them to complete an [R Skills survey](https://www.nsssurvey2.scot.nhs.uk/index.php?r=survey/index/sid/296986/lang/en) 
and a [short exercise](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/R-exercise) 
to assess their competence with R

- We also ask them to look at our [Toolkit](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/Toolkit), which 
contains links to our resources on R, RMarkdown, version control, RAP, shiny 
and more


## Buddying in action

- The first publication to undergo the buddy system is the [Scottish Bowel Screening Programme Statistics](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Cancer/Publications/2018-08-07/2018-08-07-Bowel-Screening-Publication-Report.pdf?8727663756) (SBSS)

- Two analysts created a document detailing the sections of their publication 
report which required to be automated

- They also created a plan detailing the scripts they required to write and the 
associated timelines updated fortnightly

- Since the beginning of April, they've converted most of the back end of the 
publication from SPSS to a version controlled, peer reviewed R project held in a 
GitHub repository

- Other publications we are buddying with: End of Life Care, Medicines and Mental Health, Cancelled Planned Operations


## Interested in RAP?...

- How many reports do your team produce?
- What proportion of time is spent producing reports?
- How much copying and pasting/data movement between software is involved?
- What proportion of your spreadsheet or report contains errors?
- What would the impact of mistakes in production be?
- Could your team create the report if certain team members suddenly left?
- Could you reproduce your publication statistics from 5 years ago?
